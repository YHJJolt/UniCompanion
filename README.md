Set up your own MYSql i didn't attach mine here.

After setting up, import ERD #1.sql into the sql (tables/columns)

in ur IDE, pip install everything inside of requirements.txt by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

you might have to do some changes inside the settings.py i forgot le.... buz rn last time we changed it to host
on hamachi to let other people connect. so you need to configure abit to make it local host again.

how to start/run the server when you completed everything (should be those only)

`cd FYP_Test`
^ make sure its inside the correct file/folder

`python manage.py runserver`
^ to run the server. if it fails it's probably say either you ran in inside the wrong file/folder, database wasnt 
set up correctly or the hamachi server localhost error thing
